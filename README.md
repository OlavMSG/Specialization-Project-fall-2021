My code for building a reduced order model for the linear elasticity equation on a square in 2D.
Please see the [Code used in report](code_use_for_report) for examples and plotting results 
from the report, as the [Patch Test](code_use_for_report/Patch_Test), 
[Example 1 traction forces](code_use_for_report/Example_1_traction_forces) and 
[Example 2 ``Gravity in 2D´´](code_use_for_report/Example_2_Gravity_in_2D).
Whereas [Code not use in report](code_not_used_for_report) has some unused example code and 
old plotting/example code.
